Dictionaries
A dictionary is another type of container object that is different from sequences such as strings, tuples, and lists. 
Dictionaries contain references to objects as key-value pairs â€” each key in the dictionary is associated with a value, 
much like each word in an English language dictionary is associated with a definition. 
As of Python 3.7, dictionary elements maintain their insertion order. 
The dict type implements a dictionary in Python.
