Wanda's Wall Cleaning offers regularly scheduled wall cleaning and maintenance services for homeowner's. Write a program called wall_clean.py to help customers choose a service plan. Prompt the user to input the following information:

Wall height
Number of cleaning visits per month
Number of "deep cleaning" visits per year
Based on the input, use branching to recommend appropriate service plan options:

A customer with a wall height of 8 feet or less, with less than 4 visits per month and less than 3 deep cleanings per year should choose Plan A at $48 per month.
A customer with a wall height of 8 feet or less, with 4 or more visits per month OR 3 or more deep cleanings per year should choose Plan B at $58 per month.
A customer with a wall height of more than 8 feet, with less than 4 visits per month and less than 3 deep cleanings per year should choose Plan C at $62 per month.
A customer with a wall height of more than 8 feet, with 4 or more visits per month OR 3 or more deep cleanings per year should choose Plan D at $66 per month.
